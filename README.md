> The game Snake is a classic video game where the player controls a snake moving within a grid. The main objective is to eat food scattered throughout the grid to make the snake grow while avoiding hitting the walls of the grid or its own body. Each time the snake eats food, its length increases and the player scores points. The snake moves continuously in one direction, and the player can change its direction using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or its own body. As the snake grows longer, the game becomes more challenging because it's harder to navigate through the grid without hitting something.
